# Chiclet

A "howcatchem" in the style of a _particular_ popular series of capcom games (Objection!).
Or Columbo.
Or, for that matter, Sherlock Holmes (just the stuff that's out of copyright though).

Probably this is the wrong name...

# Summary

Pallas Grey is a talented college student.
Two of Pallas' professors are in a cat-and-mouse game with each other and attempt to use her as a pawn.
Eventually, due to a series of accidents and tragedies she is able to unravel their web of crimes and use the more-moral one against the other and uncover everything.

She is given an automatic A in both classes.

The two professors are both Criminal in some sense, both professionally and personally:

- Statov d'Artes in Psychology & Medicine
- Steward D Moore in Law & Methods

Both are running criminal enterprises disguised as a series of clubs and businesses.

- d'Artes' Angley Gangley, a cool kids club that follows fads
- d'Artes' stake in HiTek Labs, which does various evidentiary services
  - Which is _of course_ compromised
- Moore's Guards R Us security services
  - But in fact, this is used for blackmail.

# Timeline & Events

## Eighteen months ago: The Case of the Book Wyrm

(not played through)
April 1st:
Al Weaver is expelled for cheating (which he _was_ doing -- purchasing grades from Paula Piu).
A student (Maddie Nough) releases her boyfriend (Al Weaver)'s pet python Rossum von Python in the library as breakup revenge.

A few days later:
The python becomes a rumor.
Weaver immediately begins a vlog of sleeping in places he shouldn't ("Dreaming with Weaver").

### What actually happened

The python was immediately caught by campus guard Ben Donin (Guards R Us)
His employer, Moore, keeps the python as a pet and suppresses the news (he doesn't want to return it to Chas).
He has Weaver expelled to protect his stolen snake.

## One year ago: The Case of the Spotted Band (part 1)

A student (Paula Piu) turns up strangled to death in a locked-room mystery in the university library.

The guard (Ben Donin) is briefly accused of the murder.
Ben claims in a panic it was a local drifter (but evidence doesn't stack up).
At this time, Pallas and then beat-cop Chiclet become friends, since she was briefly a suspect.

Pallas is able to prove it was actually a terrible accident:
_death by snake_, Rossum von Python!!!
(resident in the library after all this time, covered up to prevent embarrassment by the guard).

The case ends somewhat unsatisfactorally since the case against Ben isn't airtight.

### What actually happened

This was a frame job.

Paula had became entangled in and aware of both professors' criminal enterprises.
(she was a psychology student who temped in the lab, and was being blackmailed by Muninn for selling grades)
Paula attempted to leverage this and blackmail d'Artes for grades -- who promptly killed her via strangulation with a rope.
d'Artes blackmailed Moore by telephone to help coverup (leverage: d'Artes credibly threatened to frame Moore for the crime).

Ben physically removed evidence suggesting Weaver at site because of their friendship.

Moore remotely erased the security records (which allows d'Artes to escape) which leaves Ben out to dry.
Moore makes this falsification seem like Ben's fault (who believes it is his own fault).

Al Weaver saw "a professor" there that night, but doesn't know which one.

Moore eventually sacrificed "his" pet snake as a favor to Ben to clear him of the crime.

## One semester ago

Chiclet is promoted to Detective and is partnered with Inspector Alexander Head.
Pallas declares her dual major.
Pallas becomes roommates with another suspect in the Spotted Band case, Erin Head (Alexander's niece).
Ben begins dating Maddie Nough.
Sam Kunk steals a sportscar from Lapis Lazuli.

## One day ago: The Case of the Guard Who Died Twice (part 1)

Ben Donin turns up bludgeoned to death[^1] at Hitek Labs.

[^1]: This isn't true; he's actually beaten _and_ poisoned.

Chiclet's superior Head immediately arrested Weaver for the crime, because Weaver was onsite and had Ben's keyring.
And Head attempts to link him to the Case of the Spotted Band.
Weaver maintains his innocence.

## Right now: The Case Of the Spotted Band As A Study

Pallas, Erin, and Prof Moore are doing a case study of a case.
Erin is prosecuting Ben Donin as the killer of Paula Piu.
Pallas is defending, using the snake as the killer.
Prof d'Artes is giving a psychological profile of Donin as erratic, depressed, and unreliable.

However, at a climactic moment, Pallas' phone goes off and interrupts class!
It's Chiclet; he remembers Pallas' connection to the case, and tells her they found the vagrant from the Spotted Band case.
The wrongful "perp" is Al Weaver.
And he's suspected of killing Ben Donin.

Moore suspends the mock trial to tomorrow since the momentum is gone.

Weaver was sleeping at the lab for his vlog.
He had been at the library during the Spotted Band, where Ben Donin also let him in.
He reveals that Ben let him in (as he often did -- whenever Ben's mysterious girlfriend wasn't around).
He had Ben's house keys because they were friends.
He reveals that Ben was a member of a new club he'd been suggesting Weaver join.
He slept at the lab, recorded his episode, posted it on delay, and left.
He was immediately arrested.

Chiclet reveals that in the night:
Ben did his rounds, left a paper logbook because the computer was down, and was killed shortly after 2am.
The logbook had frequent visits from a Maddie Nough up through the last week.
d'Artes had left at 1am after working late as proven by a toll stub.

Maddie (same maddie!) reveals she broke up with Ben because he was getting paranoid and weird.
She's an apiarist.
He had a phobia of bees.
And his job as a guard meant they could never see each other.
He had been trying to get over his fear of bees as a surprise for her.
She thinks it was from Hitek labs.

Pallas interviews the doctor that found the body, Jade Basil.
Jade was working overnight for the county coroner.
Jade is a member of the Angley Gangley club -- fashionable collectors.
She can't really afford her membership car.
Most recently, there were fads to go to the gym at 6am, purchase cup noodle at a nearby deli, etc.
The last time she saw Ben was during Ben's rounds.
Then she heard sounds of a struggle.
By the time she got there, Ben was dead.

Reexamining the logbook, Ben's been frequently late for work in ways that align with club activity.

Confronting Jade with the evidence that the club was interfering with Ben,
Jade panics and reveals it was to arrange for secret meetings with local criminal The Skunk.
She suggests Skunk and Ben got into a physical fight; Skunk killed him?
This is borne out by the logbook; Skunk was to visit at 1:30a.
The final evidence is a photograph he took of Skunk attacking Ben which she reveals rather than be accused herself.

Head releases Weaver with a warning, and the search for The Skunk begins.

### What actually happened

Most of this is true, but reveals the presence of the mastermind.
This will be revealed in a future case:

d'Artes became paranoid & concerned Moore was using Guards R Us to investigate HiTek.
Moore was! He had become aware that d'Artes was falsifying evidence.
And wanted to use his access to get proof of it to defeat his own blackmailer while he could.

d'Artes used labwork to become aware of Ben's allergy to bees.
He did this by making Ben depressed, splitting him up with his girlfriend etc (via the Angley Gangley).
Then he got a diagnosis.

d'Artes secretly injected Ben with bee venom and left.
Skunk attacked "the guard", spiking his heart rate, as requested.
But then the guy collapsed; the job was only to scare him so he tried to administer an epipen.
But it was doctored; this killed Ben. Skunk fled.
And then d'Artes destroyed the evidence.
And he used the system's reset during _daylight savings time_ to cover the discrepency between a 1am ticket stub and a 2am logbook entry.

This is revealed later.

## The next day: The Case of the Spotted Band part 2

Pallas, Erin Head (her roommate), and Prof Moore resume the mock trial in the case of Paula Piu.
Now everyone thinks the whole thing is in poor taste (Since the man is dead)

But given the new connections, she wants to use the chance to get Maddie Nough to talk more.

Pallas suspects that somehow Maddie may be behind Paula's case _and_ Ben's case, since both have turned up dead in her orbit.
In this world, Maddie trained Rossum von Python to attack and used him to kill Paula.
She did it because she suspected Ben was cheating on her, since he had a mysterious girlfriend and has a history of violence.
And in this world she killed Paula for the same reason.
And she used the snake to do it.

Maddie defends herself:
She and Paula had been drifting apart and seen fighting.
Paula was getting involved with a bad boy, Skunk.
She hadn't started dating Ben by the time Paula was killed, they started dating afterwards.
And: she is afraid of snakes.

Moore plays the judge. Questions evidence, etc.

Pallas learns that Ben was getting treated for his bee allergy.
And that this was happening at HiTek.

They learn it can't have been Rossum von Python because Ben _did_ capture the snake.
Moore questions whether the snake could have escaped again.
Maddie doesn't know.

Pallas clears Maddie, and is stuck with her original theory: Paula killed by snake.
But then who/what killed Ben?
Prof Moore suggests following up on his allergy shots.

### What really happened

What seemed to happen; Moore wanted to take temperature of the investigation using a student.
And wanted to see if Maddie could get framed.
Decides probably not.
So: tries to use Pallas to finish the work Ben had been doing.

## Guard Who Died Twice 2

Pallas goes to her criminal psych class, meets with Prof d'Artes.
Confides guardedly about her concerns for Weaver and poor Ben.
Still believes there's something out there connecting the cases.

d'Artes reveals he's on his way to his lab to complete tests in connection to Ben's murder.
He suggests perhaps something in the evidence will be a clue towards whoever's behind this all.
His theory is that Ben would have had to have a reason to do the killings which doesn't fit his profile.
Some sort of shady employer.

Helps her look through the evidence; she discovers a blood draw for Ben Donin.
(screening for meds).
Allergy to bees.
Preliminary autopsy consistent with a struggle and beating.
d'Artes reveals this was required by his employer, Guards R Us, due to his being so erratic.
He'd suggested it, as a friend and a client.

d'Artes suggests that there's a lot of signs that there's something fishy at Guards R Us.
He further suggests that blackmail could be behind everything:
he's long suspected that the company is crooked.

He drops the bombshell: it's owned by Moore, and runs security systems that were central to previous cases!.
He believes that Moore behaves erratically and has been running a criminal empire behind the scenes:
he's a frequent expert witness for the defense and kind of shady.
He uses the class mock trials to determine what evidence should go missing.

Chiclet doesn't have enough evidence to do anything there yet, but suggests Pallas has a personal connection so she can go ask questions.
d'Artes suggests helpful lines of inquiry (ask about the snake, ask about the library records being unavailable)
Chiclet meanwhile reviews the evidence and decides to track down this "Skunk" through legwork.

### What really happened

Basically all of this is true.

## The Case of the Hot Rod

The strategy is to investigate Moore and determine the extent of his crimes.
Pallas can talk to him in office hours, but he stonewalls and sours their relationship.
He denies everything.
He insists he'll talk about class- or case-work, but he doesn't have to sit here and take this.

However, after discovering his lack of cooperation, Chiclet comes through with Sam Concowitz "The Skunk".
He's a car thief, but never prosecuted.
And despite stealing Zeta Grecianos, Edisons, Spin Kings, BNWs, Loci, Angley, etc; he's very poor.
(Alfa Romeo, Tesla, Rolls Royce, BMW, Lexus, Bentley, etc)
He's also very frugal, so where did the money go?

Pallas considers asking Chiclet to arrest him for the beating & death of Ben Donin.
Chiclet isn't sure -- with the experience of the Spotted Band, without more evidence he doesn't think it'll work.
And Kunk rebuffs her questions. He clearly knows something, but there's no leverage.

Pallas determines: If she can uncover evidence from a former crime against Skunk, she can crack him open.

The case relies on a car which was hastily painted on only one side to evade detection, revealed by a mirror that was later broken.

- Owner: Livia Lapis
  - license L4ZUL1
- Thief: Definitely Sam Concowitz, but nobody could prove it
- Livia had a meeting of the Angley Gangley, other rich car owners of old European sports cars.
- He hired Concowitz to valet because they met at the Motor Pool
- Lazuli was Stolen from Livia's home garage, which is a symmetric space with room for a dozen cars.
- It had other cars of all colors:
  - "Red" Robbie Baron
    - License 3H0T0NE, American
  - Andy Marillo
    - License JEEP3R5, British
  - Jade Basil
    - License 3NV10U5, British
  - There are other members, but they couldn't make this meeting
- Somehow, Red Robbie Baron left the party twice, with the gate camera catching his red car leaving twice
- But there was a view of the room with no real time lapses, and the cars were seen continuously.
- Sam says that he took a nap, and it wasn't his job to watch the cars; Livia should have hired security!
- Eventually the investigating cops had to close the case and let insurance make everyone whole.
  - But of course, L4ZUL1 is irreplacable...

### What actually happend

- "it takes 2 hours to paint a car, and the car wasn't left out of sight for more than 10m, and time elapsed was 1h10m"
  - By use of a 45 degree mirror, the car was secretly half painted in a different color while seeming to still be onsite.
- Then it was driven out _as though_ it were the 3HOTONE (and the camera on that side didn't see differently)
- Then the _real_ 3HOTONE drove out and the event was discovered.
- The proof is a switched steering wheel on one of the cars (because of the mirror).
  During the case, Moore doctored the photograph to overwrite the expected license plate.
  But didn't notice to do the steering wheel!

Sam kept a box of Paula's things. When Pallas switches tactics and asks about her, he shares the two-toned photo.
Pallas uses this to lever Sam open, who reveals he promised the car to Paula but had to sell it because he was being blackmailed by Muninn.
He can't exactly explain how he got off, but the photos of the event were definitely doctored.

It's a dead-drop thing; he leaves the money at HiTek labs.
(where it was collected by Ben Donin).
This is what made Paula suspicious about the dual empires BTW.

So:
We have the evidence now to get Sam on the car theft.
He reveals his side of the blackmail story.
And volunteers that the blackmailer most recently told him to attack someone at the dead drop instead of using the dead drop!
And apologizes.
He never actually attacked the guy; he jumped out to scare him, the guy fell over and went into shock.
There was an epipen, which he used at the guy's insistence; the guy got worse and died.

He's scared and sorry.

## Consulting Detectives

Paula goes to d'Artes office hours again to discuss this.
Everything makes sense:

- There's a blackmailer named Muninn at the web of a series of crimes
- Paula was killed because she learned something about the blackmailer from her boyfriend Skunk
- Skunk killed Donin by accident because his blackmailer made him do it
  | (note that this is false: technically, the two blackmailers are different people!)
- The blackmailer has access to fake evidence through guard and courier services
  - This is probably part of Donin's duties
- Moore is likely the blackmailer, having means, motive, opportunity, wealth, etc.

d'Artes agrees completely.
He suggests that the Speckled Band can't have been Rossum von Python in that case, and in class Pallas should confront Moore.
She agrees.

#### What really happened

yep.

### Moore's Law Class

Pallas uses the class to force the question as a hypothetical:
"If a blackmailer forces someone to do a crime, whose fault is it"
They discuss the issue, and Moore declares the blackmailer often gets the harsher sentence.

"And if a blackmailer were to falsify evidence"
(he sweats)
Oh, that's real bad. Straight to gulag.

"and use a flash mob in the commission of their crims"
(...?! he is not sure how to react!)
(but it explains some things, and he thinks quickly...)

Uh anyway, given this kind of conspiracy, what kind of case would you build? Purely hypothetically?
(he sees the chance to pin the blame on The Other, whose identity he still doesn't know)

They'd do whatever they could to stop you from understanding the mechanisms behind their crimes, like the Speckled Band or the Guard Who Died Twice.
So climbing up their coconspirator ladder -- the Angley Gangley club -- would let you get evidence to build a case that would be too hard to cover up.

## Open problems: Car Show?

We have to actually tie this thing up.

d'Artes has (always) known about Moore, because Moore blackmailing Concowitz got back to him through Piu.
Moore saved his own blackmail demand and has been trying to build a case against his enemy, but been unsuccessful.
Presumably: Angley Gangley club has both interfered and could be flipped?

We go to another of their meetings (in Chiclet's beater! comedy gold!)

Jade is the most sympathetic, so she does what she can to talk about it.
All of the members call each other by their car names.
The chief is MOOR4NJ, who drives a cheery orange car.

And who should we see but Moore? _and_ d'Artes!
But it eventually turns out that Moore doesn't drive the cheery orange but the gloomy grey SHD0FAX.

And so Pallas has everything she's thought about so far cast into a new light, because Moore was basically right:
whoever was running the Angley Gangley was using it to cover up opportunities for crime.
And so the leader of the pack -- who has a gift for misdirection and manipulation! -- is behind everything.

All that remains is to actually "bring it home".

## Climax: Justice is Served

d'Artes did it all: he physically strangled Paula when she attempted to blackmail him.
Then he used Sam Concowitz to kill Ben Donin, relying on his ability to fix the evidence to cover the crime.
He'd blame that -- as well as other evidence problems -- on Moore, using the evidence of Sam's previous case to suggest Moore had a pattern of this.

Thus, when Moore claims that actually d'Artes killed Paula, he'd be able to suggest it was simply a lie for any evidence produced.

However!

He didn't know Sam had dated Paula, a total coincidence.
And that the evidence of the stolen car in that case was the car that he had received when he took over "double blackmailing" Sam.

The thing we should be most suspicious of now is that the evidence that clears him comes from his own lab, so we need to prove that there are "alternates" for evidence that d'Artes'd previously said Moore had falsified.

We have the "ticking time bomb" of the daylight savings time from the previous case.
So that's what we should use here: a ticket stub from the Spotted Band that indicates it was daylight savings implicated.
And so his alibi is pierced, and he's the professor that was on site.

Time... to face the music.
